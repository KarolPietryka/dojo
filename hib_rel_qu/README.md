Create a simple web application for a movie database where users can view a list of movieEntities, add new movieEntities, and edit or delete existing movieEntities. The application should use JPA and Hibernate to persist movie data in a database.

Here are some suggested steps to implement this project:

1. Set up a new Spring Boot project using Maven or Gradle.
2. Create a Movie entity class with attributes such as title, director, release year, and genre. Add appropriate annotations such as **`@Entity`**, **`@Id`**, and **`@GeneratedValue`** to map the entity to a database table.
3. Create a MovieRepository interface that extends the **`JpaRepository`** interface to perform CRUD operations on the Movie entity.
4. Create related entities such as Director, Genre, and Review. Use the **`@ManyToOne`**, **`@OneToMany`**, **`@OneToOne`**, and **`@ManyToMany`** annotations to establish relationships between entities. For example, a movie can have one director, but a director can direct multiple movieEntities. A movie can have multiple genres, and a genre can be associated with multiple movieEntities.
5. Use the **`@NamedQuery`** or **`@NamedQueries`** annotations to define custom queries for the Movie entity. For example, you can create a named query to retrieve movieEntities by genre or release year.
6. Implement unit tests for the Movie entity and MovieRepository classes using a testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG. Test methods such as saving a new movie, retrieving a movie by ID, and deleting a movie. Also, test the named queries to verify that they return the expected results.
7. Implement integration tests for the MovieController class to test the HTTP endpoints and verify that the controller interacts correctly with the repository. Use a testing framework such as Spring Boot Test or Rest Assured to simulate HTTP requests and verify the response data.
8. Use Hibernate to persist the Movie entity data in a database. You can use an embedded database such as H2 for simplicity or a production database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for more realism.
9. Use the **`@Transactional`** annotation to ensure that JPA transactions are used when interacting with the database.
10. Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform such as Heroku or AWS.
