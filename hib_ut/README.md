Set up a new Spring Boot project using Maven or Gradle.

Create a Book entity class with attributes such as title, author, description, and price. Add appropriate annotations such as @Entity, @Id, and @GeneratedValue to map the entity to a database table.

Create a BookRepository interface that extends the JpaRepository interface to perform CRUD operations on the Book entity.

Create a BookController class that handles HTTP requests and calls methods in the BookRepository to retrieve or modify bookEntity data.

Implement unit tests for the Book entity and BookRepository classes using a testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG. Test methods such as saving a new bookEntity, retrieving a bookEntity by ID, and deleting a bookEntity.

Implement integration tests for the BookController class to test the HTTP endpoints and verify that the controller interacts correctly with the repository. Use a testing framework such as Spring Boot Test or Rest Assured to simulate HTTP requests and verify the response data.

Use Hibernate to persist the Book entity data in a database. You can use an embedded database such as H2 for simplicity or a production database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for more realism.
